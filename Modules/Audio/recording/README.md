Here's some sample code that demonstrates how you could record video and audio using the built-in camera and microphone of a laptop using Python and the OpenCV and PyAudio libraries

This code creates a VideoWriter object that saves the video to a file named "output.avi" with a codec of XVID and a frame rate of 20 frames per second. The built-in camera of the laptop is accessed using the VideoCapture function with the argument 0, which usually corresponds to the built-in camera.

PyAudio is used to record audio and write it to a file named 'audio.wav', which will contain the audio recorded during the video recording.

You can press "q" to stop the recording.

Please make sure you have installed OpenCV and PyAudio library. You can do this by running pip install opencv-python and pip install pyaudio in the command prompt if you are using python 2 and for python3 use pip3 install opencv-python-headless and pip3 install PyAudio

Please also be aware that video and audio recording may be restricted on certain systems or in certain locations, and you should always obtain the necessary permissions before recording.
